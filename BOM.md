Depending on how you want to wire the keyboard, you can either use single key PCB's like amoeba, or amoeba royale/king, or do a pure hand wired keyboard.

For my build I used amoeba pcb's I bought from keebio : https://keeb.io/products/amoeba-single-switch-pcbs

I also used mill-max hot-swap sockets: https://keeb.io/products/mill-max-hotswap-sockets (i think i had some knockoffs from Temu that worked just fine)

You can also choose to get other single key PCB's and i would recommend Amoeba king's from [Jking-B16](https://github.com/JKing-B16/keyboard-pcbs/tree/master/amoeba-king)

for those you need to source diodes and hotswap sockets:

Controller PCB gerbers are in the [hardware](./hardware) folder, ready to send to jlcpcb.You can see the whole source at https://github.com/adaryorg/lil-pcb 

Switches and keycaps are a completely individual choice. Just make sure to have 64 switches and enough keycaps for the keyboard.

# Tools

Useful tools needed for a build like this: 

1. soldering iron
2. solder
3. wire cutters
4. wire strippers
5. some kind of third hand device to hold things in place
6. sponge or brass shavings to clean the soldering iron tipthe
